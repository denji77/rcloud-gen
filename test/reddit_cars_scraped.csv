What Car Should I Buy? - A Weekly Megathread,"Location: Midwest, USA

Price range: $20-50k

Lease or Buy: Open to either, but have never leased.

New or used: Typically choose used with less than 20k miles, but new would be fine.

Type of vehicle: Sedan

Must haves: AWD, Leather, Sunroof. Ideally it is fun to drive and I can toss it into ""manual"" mode, downshift, and easily pass people on the highway.

Desired transmission: Auto (but oh how I wish I could convince my wife on this one, I miss my six speed RX-8)

Intended use: Daily Driver/Family Car

Vehicles you've already considered: 

Is this your 1st vehicle: No, it will replace a 2015 Mazda CX-5 w/ 95k miles.

Do you need a Warranty: ideally it comes with one.

Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: yes

Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no thanks

Additional Notes:

Replacing an awesome Mazda CX-5, that is just about to turn over 100k miles soon. While the CX-5 is great, I do feel like the tech is outdated and it's a bit slower than I'd like, plus our other vehicle is a 2020 Mazda CX-9, and we don't need two SUV's. It's crazy to me how many sedans are either no longer made or this is their last model year.  My first stop was to look at a Mazda 6, only to find they stopped making them in 2021. 

I'm currently very much on the fence on whether I should get an EV. I commute ~20 miles each way for work 4 days a week, and drive the kids around to activities nearly daily. I would enjoy an EV's fast acceleration off the line, but probably miss the sound of a sporty engine.  I typically keep a vehicle for 8-12 years before selling it, which makes me very uncomfortable with the idea of leasing. 

If EV's did not exist I'd be trying to convince my wife something like a used BMW M3 is perfect, and thinking we're finally getting back to driving fun cars! However, my wife has said that since technically this is her car we're swapping out it needs 4 doors, and an automatic transmission.  Every time I look at something like Mazda 3 with a turbo I think to myself, if I want fast, just get an EV.

What Car Should I Buy? - A Weekly Megathread,"Location: USA, Maryland

Price range: $30,000-60,000

Lease or Buy: either

New or used: either 

Type of vehicle: EV with room for 2 people and enough room for gear for a camping trip. 

Must haves: EV, heated seats, good driving dynamics, and fun/unique. 

Intended use: daily driver. My only car. 

Vehicles you've already considered: Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV9, Mustang Mach-E, Tesla Model 3/Y, Lucid Air Pure, Rivian, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Lyriq, etc. 

Is this your 1st vehicle: No. currently have a 2021 Tesla Model Y with 95,000 miles on it. 

Do you need a Warranty: It’s an EV, so yeah probably. 

Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Yes. 

Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: No. 

Additional Notes:

I’m trying to get out of my Tesla Model Y for a number of reasons. Mostly the suspension is horrendous and Elon Musk is an asshat. Otherwise I LOVE the technology and how easy it is to daily. I’ve taken it on a ton of road trips and it has been flawless and fault-free for five years now. 

My #1 choice so far has been either the Ioniq 5 or Lucid Air Pure. The problem with both is pretty obvious: the Ioniq 5 ICCU issues are a huge problem and Hyundai is failing to actually fix them.  On the other side, Lucid is a startup EV company that could announce they’re closing any day. I haven’t test driven either one yet because I’m worried that would convince me to go ahead and buy/lease then and there.  

My head says “get the Ioniq 5 for a good lease deal, or keep driving the Tesla into the ground” my heart says “lease the Lucid and enjoy having the range and incredible driving experience.”

Tuesday Tune-Up - Post all your vehicle maintenance questions here,"I drive a 2009 Kia Sorento and I am planning on selling it at the end of the month because I am moving abroad for graduate school.

It has about 120k miles on it and some rust and wear and tear.

I was previously having issues with the transmission but it seems like the transmission fluid was just low, and it's been driving fine since. But that code might show up in the history.

The issue is I have not passed the Massachusetts state inspection and my mechanic said there's an issue with the exhaust/flex pipe (I'm not a car person idk) that would be about $700-800 to fix. The rotors/brakes also need some work for about $500 but it could pass inspection without that being done.

My question is should I go through with the repair before selling to increase the car value, or will I just be putting more money into it than I would even get back on it?

Also, approximately how much should I be looking to sell it for?",6,1,1756814435.0,tuesday tune up post all your vehicle maintenance questions here i drive a kia sorento and i am planning on selling it at the end of the month because i am moving abroad for graduate school it has about k miles on it and some rust and wear and tear i was previously having issues with the transmission but it seems like the transmission fluid was just low and it s been driving fine since but that code might show up in the history the issue is i have not passed the massachusetts state inspection and my mechanic said there s an issue with the exhaust flex pipe i m not a car person idk that would be about to fix the rotors brakes also need some work for about but it could pass inspection without that being done my question is should i go through with the repair before selling to increase the car value or will i just be putting more money into it than i would even get back on it also approximately how much should i be looking to sell it for

A Dodge Charger EV Driver Got a Ticket for a Loud Exhaust,"Reading the article it sure sounds like the trooper wanted to go after the guy who left the light ahead of the Charger, but decided he could just pin it on the Charger driver instead.

It’s worth pointing out, should it go to court, that the synthesized exhaust noise is part of the DOT-mandated pedestrian alert sound.  Yes it can be turned off and switched to a standard “angelic halo” noise like most EVs, but even in the louder race modes (which the driver claims he was not in) at standstill it certainly shouldn’t be too loud.

I mean real or fake it was loud no? if I rev my engine at a stoplight or if I have speakers on the exterior playing loud revving exhaust sounds what's the functional difference? 

> but then arguably goes too far when stock vehicles are being cited as nuisances

I don't think its too far, a 911.2 GT3 with the valves open is an incredibly loud car and will be cited under nyc law at full bore, and I say this as someone who owned a 911.2 GT3, I felt it was reasonable enough to keep the valves closed in the city

I mean I find it really odd that Minnesota just bans ""excessive or unusual noise"" altogether instead of stating some objective limit, I feel like thats ripe for abuse, but I don't live there for a reason

A Dodge Charger EV Driver Got a Ticket for a Loud Exhaust,"The charger has the ability to be obnoxious, but the story and owner seem to imply that the car couldn't have even been the one being loud

> Mike says that the ruckus was caused by another car pulling away while he was stopped. The Charger EV can “rev” quite loudly, but it has to be put in Park to do that. It can also produce a fake engine noise while moving, but it must be in Sport mode for that. Mike told us he had his car set to the Auto drive mode at the time because he was low on battery, and that setting keeps the synthesized sounds to a minimum

The owner could definitely be lying about being low on battery and/or in ""auto"" mode, but needing to be in park and/or moving to make loud ""exhaust"" noise seems to back him up that it was likely someone else.

A Dodge Charger EV Driver Got a Ticket for a Loud Exhaust,"I have no idea if this guy is telling the truth or not, but something similar happened to me 20+ years ago.

I had a silver Mk4 GTI 1.8T with a big turbo and a Techtonics exhaust in the early to mid 2000s. Admittedly, it was loud at full throttle, but reasonable if you drove normally. I pulled up to a traffic light beside a silver EP3 Civic SiR. He launches it out of the light and speeds away, assuming I want to race. I drive away normally and a block or so later I'm being pulled over.

The officer in this story sounds exactly the same. I explained that it was the Civic hatch, not me, that made a bunch of noise and took off (the two cars look very similar from a distance).

A Dodge Charger EV Driver Got a Ticket for a Loud Exhaust,"> No matter the resolution, this is one of those situations that weirdly encapsulates the modern environment of ~~driving cars that happen to be fast or loud~~ **law-enforcement officers not knowing the laws they enforce or being held accountable for their actions.**

- In Ohio, you can be cited for speeding [even if you weren't](https://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2010/oh-visual.pdf)(PDF); you just need to *look like* you were speeding.

- In North Carolina, you can be cited for offenses that [aren't even offenses](https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/heien-v-north-carolina/)--and subsequent searches of the vehicle are still admissible.

The Volvo V90 Is Dead. Blame SUVs.,"Volvo never sent any of these to any dealers. Finding one just to test drive has been such a headache (around 2019-2020 for me, haven't checked since as we bought a different car). And I'm not blind ordering something this expensive. 

Another annoying finger pointing problem where manufacturers blame us for not buying them, but never made them readily available to try/buy. **This is coming from someone who was seriously in the market for one. I spent MONTHS looking.**

And before commenters blame dealers, save your breath. I'd bet that Volvo, like 90% of other manufacturers, handle inventory stock and distribution at the corporate level. Very few manufacturers actually have dealers order their own inventory these days. Manufacturers pick what to distribute out based on their market analysis, their analysis sucks, and dealers just get what they get.

End Soap Box Rant. Same type of finger pointing rant as Honda blaming consumers for not buying their manual transmissions that their marketing team loves to brag about ""offering""

The Volvo V90 Is Dead. Blame SUVs.,I think having a 4 cylinder hybrid engine while being sold as a premium car turned away a lot of potential buyers.
